# LLM Fine-tuning

## Overview

This repository contains code for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). The code is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy experimentation with different models, datasets, and training configurations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

### Create a virtual environment

- To avoid conflicts with other Python packages, it's recommended to create a virtual environment. You can do this using `venv` or `conda`. Below are the instructions for both methods.

```bash

python3 -m venv finetune-env
source finetune-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install the required packages

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
